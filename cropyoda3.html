          	Botanical Name: Solanum Lycopersicum <br>

          	Nutrients: Vitamin E,C,K, Potassium, Manganese <br>

          	<b> Planting instructions: </b> </br>
          	 1. If your container doesn&#39;t already have them, drill ¼- to ½-inch holes every few inches around the bottom edge, plus another few in the center bottom so excess water can drain. </br>
          	 2. For best fruiting, pick a location where the plant will get at least eight hours of direct sun each day. You can actually skip the tomato cage — and save a little cash — if you have a spot close to a balcony or railing, which you can use to support the tomato vines. </br>
			       3. If you do go with a cage, insert the pointy end into the planter, and then fill the planter with potting mix. </br>
			       4. Water until the potting mix is evenly moist. Top it off with a little more potting mix, adding enough so it comes to about ½ inch below the rim of the planter and making sure the soil surface is level. </br>
			       5. Dig a small hole in the center of the planting mix. Carefully remove your tomato plant from its original pot (unless the pot is designed to dissolve), and slide it into the hole, planting it deep enough so only the top four to six leaves show once you cover it back up with potting mix. </br>
			       6. Water every two or three days to keep the soil evenly moist (in hot, dry weather you may need to water every day). Feed your plant fertilizer once a week, according to directions. </br>

      		<b> Planting Instructions </b> </br>
      		1. To prepare soil, till in aged manure or compost. </br> 
			   2. Start cabbage seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last spring frost in your area. Consult our
				  Planting Calendar for suggested dates. </br>
			   3. Before planting the seedlings outdoors, harden off the plants over the course of a week. </br>
		      4. Transplant outdoors 2 to 3 weeks before the last expected frost date. If possible, plant on a cloudy day so that the seedlings aren’t subjected to intense sunlight right away. </br>
			    5. Plant 12 to 24 inches apart in rows, depending on the size of head desired. The closer you plant, the smaller the cabbages. </br>
			     6. Because cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower are closely related, and require similar nutrients, it’s best not to plant them together. They are all heavy feeders, depleting the soil faster of required nutrients; plus, they will attract the same pests and diseases. For cabbage, also avoid proximity to strawberries and tomatoes. </br>
			     7. Cabbages can be grown near beans and cucumbers. Check out our chart of plant companions for an expanded list of friends and foes. </br>

          Botanical Name: Spinacia Oleracca </br>

          Soil Type: Loamy </br>
          Nutrients: Vitamin A,B,C </br> </br>

          <b> Planting Instructions </b> </br>

          1. Prepare the soil with aged manure about a week before planting, or, you may wish to prepare your spot in the fall so that you can sow the seeds outdoors in early spring as soon as the ground thaws. </br>
		      2.  If you live in a place with mild winters, you can also plant in the fall. </br>
		      3. Although seedlings can be propagated indoors, it is not recommended, as seedlings are difficult to transplant. </br>
		      4. Spring plantings can be made as soon as the soil can be properly worked. It’s important to seed as soon as you can to give spinach the required 6 weeks of cool weather from seeding to harvest. </br>	5. Select a site with full sun to light shade and well-drained soil. </br>
		      6. Sow seeds ½ inch to 1 inch deep, covering lightly with soil. Sow about 12 seeds per foot of row, or sprinkle over a wide row or bed. </br>
		      7. Soil should not be warmer than 70º F in order for germination. </br>
		      8. Successive plantings should be made every couple weeks during early spring. Common spinach cannot grow in midsummer. (For a summer harvest, try New Zealand Spinach or Malabar Spinach, two similar leafy greens.) </br>
		      9. Plant in mid-August for a fall crop, ensuring that soil temps are cool enough. </br>
		      10. Gardeners in northern climates can harvest early-spring spinach if it’s planted just before the cold weather arrives in fall. Protect the young plants with a cold frame or thick mulch through the winter, then remove the protection when soil temperature in your area reaches 40º. </br>
		      11. Water the new plants well in the spring. </br>

          <h2 style="padding-left: 300px; margin-top: -250px"> Cucumber </h2>

          <p style="margin-left: 300px; margin-bottom: 100px">
          Botanical Name: Cucumis Sativus</br>
          Plant Type: Vegetable </br>
          Sun Exposure: Full sun </br>	
          Soil Type: Loamy </br>
          Nutrients: Potassium, Fiber, Vitamin C </br> </br>

          <b> Planting Instructions </b> </br>

          1. Cucumber plants are seeded or transplanted outside in the ground no earlier than 2 weeks after last frost date. Cucumbers are extremely susceptible to frost damage; the soil must be at least 70ºF for germination. Do not plant outside too soon! </br>
          2. Before you plant outside, select a site with full sun. </br>
          3. Soil should be neutral or slightly alkaline with a pH of 7.0. </br>
          4. Cucumbers require fertile soil. Mix in compost and/or aged manure before planting to a depth of 2 inches and work into the soil 6 to 8 inches deep. Make sure that soil is moist and well-drained, not soggy. </br>
          5. Improve clay soil by adding organic matter. Improve dense, heavy soil by adding peat,
          compost or rotted manure. (Get a soil test if you are unsure of your soil type; contact your local county cooperative extension.) Light, sandy soils are preferred for northern gardens, as they warm quickly in the spring. See our guide to soil amendments. </br>
          6. Plant seedlings one inch deep and about 36 to 60 inches apart, depending on variety. For vines trained on a trellis, space plants 1 foot apart. </br>
          7. For an early crop, start cucumber seeds indoors about 3 weeks before you transplant
          them in the ground. They like bottom heat of about 70ºF (21ºC). If you don’t have a heat mat, put the seeds flat on top of the refrigerator or perch a few on top of the water heater. </br> 
          8. If you live in the cooler climates, you can help warm the soil by covering the hill or row
          with black plastic. </br>
          9. Once the ground is warm, mulch with pine straw, chopped leaves, or another organic mulch to keep pests at bay, and also keep bush types off the ground to avoid disease. </br>
          10. A trellis is a good idea if you want the vine to climb, or if you have limited space.
          Trellising also protects the fruit from damage from lying on the moist ground. </br>

          Botanical Name: Brassica Rapa Rapifera Group</br>

          Nutrients: Fiber, Vitamin C, K, A, E, B1, B3, minerals </br> </br>

          <b> Planting Instructions </b> </br>

          1. For a late spring harvest, sow turnip seeds directly in the garden as soon as the ground is workable, usually 2 to 3 weeks before the average last frost date. </br> 
          2. For an autumn harvest, sow turnips in late summer. Sow after summer crops of onions, squash, beans or sweet corn. </br>
          3. You can also sow seeds in early autumn for a late autumn harvest. </br>
          4. Turnips are seeded directly into the garden; they do not transplant well. </br>
          5. Select a site that gets full sun. </br>
          6. Soil should be well-draining and loosened to a depth of 12 to 15 inches. </br>
          7. In advance, mix in a 2- to 4-inch layer of compost or aged manure. Add sand to heavy, clay soil. </br>
          8. Scatter turnip seed. Do not cover the seeds with more than ½ an inch of soil. </br>
          9. Once seedlings are 4 inches high, thin them to 4 to 6 inches apart. Space wide rows 12
          inches apart. </br>
          10.Thin turnips grown for greens from 2 to 3 inches apart (or, some of us don’t bother
          thinning for greens at all). </br>
